TASKS :

====> problem
-> What to do (difficulty)
-> what to do next (difficulty)
difficulty : 
(*)   = easy
(**)  = medium
(***) = hard
                
====> allow users to move and zoom through the playground
-> zoom mecanism (***)

====> click on the screen to create a new food generator
-> allow system to add more food to the screen at each frame (*)
-> food generator with specific range (**) 

====> data more readable
-> side surface dedicated to display information (*)
-> print useful data on this panel : time_speed, fps, no. of cells alive, camera location ...(*)
-> resizable (**)
-> controler for food generator on the side surface: delete, range, food appearance rate... (*)
