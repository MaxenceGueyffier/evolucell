BIG CHALLENGES OF THE PROJECT :

1.  One cell can eat food : [OK]
2.  Several cells can reproduce and evolve : [OK]
3.  A lot of cells in a large playground : []
4.  Cells with sensors and a genetical behavior : []
5.  Multicellar oragnisms with dedicated cells : []



TASKS :

====> problem
-> What to do (difficulty)
-> what to do next (difficulty)
difficulty : 
(*)   = easy
(**)  = medium
(***) = hard
      
====> reorganization of the code in order to store each food in quadtrees because it may severely impact performance
-> merge pool_food and quadtree (***)                       

====> allow users to move and zoom through the playground
-> change size playground (*) 
-> move camera (**) 
-> zoom mecanism (***)

====> click on the screen to create a new food generator
-> allow system to add more food to the screen at each frame (*)
-> food generator with specific range (**) 
-> panel to control food generator : delete, range, food appearance rate... (**)
